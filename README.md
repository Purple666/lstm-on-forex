Applying machine learning models on Long Short-Term memory neural network


With the advancement of financial technology, the model of functioning of the Forex market has changed. By advancing computer technology, the way of trading on the Forex market changed. Instead of trading floors in financial centers where orders were shredded and brokerage requests were transmitted by telephone, today with one mouse click, from anywhere in the world you can file requests and execute orders.
Models of artificial neural networks can be applied in algorithmic trading. Although they still may not replace human intelligence, they can outpreform him in the speed of the operations and the constant presence. As training neural networks requires a large amount of data and financial markets generates enormous amounts of data, it seems logical to connect these models.
